# collecting_messages_from_tg_news_channels
This repo contains the scripts to collect news texts and reactions from telegram channels

```

# no need for quotes

# you can get telegram development credentials in telegram API Development Tools
api_id = <your_api_id>
api_hash = <your_api_hash>

# use full phone number including + and country code
phone = <your_phone_number>
username = <your_user_name>
```
